2018 has been a year of fast growth for MLflow, with 66 contributors to the project and many new features including R and Java APIs, UI improvements and multiple library integrations.
To kick off 2019, we're running an [MLflow user survey](https://goo.gl/forms/bFbIiCSIoLir44rD2) to get your feedback on MLflow so far, and help us prioritize several new components we are thinking of building in 2019.

Please take a few minutes to [fill in the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/bFbIiCSIoLir44rD2) if you have feedback.
All entrants will have a chance to win an MLflow T-shirt or a ticket to [Spark + AI Summit 2019](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit).

Happy new year, and we look forward to hearing from you,

The MLflow Team
