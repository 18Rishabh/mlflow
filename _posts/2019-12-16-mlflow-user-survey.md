2019 has been a year of fast growth for MLflow, with 160 contributors to the project, the release of MLflow 1.0 & model registry, and multiple library integrations.
To kick off 2020, we're running an [MLflow user survey](https://forms.gle/eybQPUdVGS7V4GDL8) to get your feedback on MLflow so far, and help us prioritize several new components we are thinking of building in 2020.

Please take a few minutes to [fill in the survey](https://forms.gle/eybQPUdVGS7V4GDL8) if you have feedback.
All entrants will have a chance to win an MLflow T-shirt.

Happy new year, and we look forward to hearing from you,

The MLflow Team
