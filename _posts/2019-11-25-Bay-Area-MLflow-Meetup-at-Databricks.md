## Talk 1: Managing the Full Deployment Lifecycle of Models with the MLflow Model Registry

**Presenter** : Mani Parkhe, Databricks 

**Abstract** : Abstract: MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the machine learning 
lifecycle, including experiment tracking, reproducible runs, and model packaging. In this talk, 
we provide an overview of the latest component of MLflow, the Model Registry, which serves as a 
collaborative hub where teams can share, discuss, use, inspect, and track the lineage of models. 
Model Registry was introduced in MLflow 1.4 and is in Private Preview on Databricks
               
With this addition, MLflow provides end-to-end management of the deployment lifecycle of models 
from experimentation to online testing and production, complete with approval and governance workflows.
               
**Bio**: Mani Parkhe is an ML/AI Platform Engineer at Databricks, focusing on the customer and 
open-source platform initiatives, which enable data discovery, training, experimentation, and 
deployment of ML models on the cloud. After spending 15 years building software for semiconductor 
chip CAD, Mani transitioned to building big data infrastructure, distributed systems and web 
services, and machine learning platforms. Prior to Databricks, he has worked on myriad 
data-intensive batch and stream processing problems at LinkedIn and Uber.


## Talk 2: MLflow on and inside Azure
**Presenter**: Akshaya Annavajhala, Microsoft

**Abstract**: 

**Bio**: Akshaya has been an engineer in the AI Platform at Microsoft for over 6 years, having 
released both GA versions of Azure Machine Learning over the years and the OSS repo MMLSpark 
along with most of the bugs associated with them. As the recent version of Azure ML pivoted to 
become more of an open platform rather than a managed product, his focus has shifted outward for 
open-source platform definitions for cloud-scale implementations and focused on MLflow for the 
Azure ML managed tracking store.


## Talk 3: TensorFlow(X) Data Validation: Better ML through better data.
**Presenter**: Alkis Polyzotis, Google

**Abstract**: Analysing and validating the input data is a necessary step before building any 
model. Moreover, any attempt to understand and debug model behaviors inadvertently requires some 
degree of data understanding. To this end, we have developed Tensorflow Data Validation (TFX) as 
a library for ML data analysis. This presentation will cover the salient functionality of TFDV, 
how it is integrated in TFX to support user workflows on model development and debugging, and our 
ongoing work to bring closer data and model analytics.

Bio: Alkis Polyzotis is a research scientist at Google Research, where he currently leads the 
data-management projects in the TensorFlow Extended (TFX) platform. His interests include data 
management for machine learning, enterprise data search, and interactive data exploration. Before 
joining Google, he was a professor at UC Santa Cruz. He has received a Ph.D. in Computer  
Sciences from the University of Wisconsin at Madison and a diploma in engineering from the 
National Tech. University of Athens, Greece.
