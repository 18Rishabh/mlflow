# MLflow Website

This is the website for the MLflow project, built on an open source Jekyll theme called [Hydra](https://github.com/CloudCannon/hydra-jekyll-template).

# Jekyll Theme Attribution

This site was built on the MIT licensed Jekyll Hydra theme

Hydra was made by [CloudCannon](http://cloudcannon.com/), the Cloud CMS for Jekyll.

# Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.
